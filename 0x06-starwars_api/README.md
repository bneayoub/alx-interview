# Star Wars API

This project comprises a set of coding exercises designed for interview practice.

## Objectives

### Star Wars Characters
The [0-starwars_characters.js](0-starwars_characters.js) script generates a list of all characters from a given Star Wars film. The script operates under the following conditions:
- The first argument should be the Movie ID. For example, `3` represents “Return of the Jedi”.
- Each character's name should appear on a new line, in the same order as the “characters” list found in the `/films/` endpoint.
- The script should make use of the [Star wars API](https://swapi-api.hbtn.io/).
- The `request` module is necessary for this task.
